# Projects

Here are some projects that I have completed and some that I am still working on:

**Automated Parking Monitoring System**: <br>
I am currently working on this project as a Senior Capstone Design Project. This project was designed to ease parking on the University of Hartford campus by providing occupancy status on each single parking space within a parking lot using Machine Learning and Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) enabled cameras connected to a Raspberry pi 5 Microcontroller. <br>
A schematic of the parking lot is designed and shown to users on a website created through REACT. Occupied parking spaces are denoted with a red box and empty spaces denoted with a green box to help students know exactly where to park and which parking lots have spots open at any given point in time. This can be extended for bigger parking lots and has several advantages over systems that use IoT sensors as the cameras used in this project have a good field of view that allows a greater coverage with less components. 
For going green and smart city initiatives, this can be an important cog in the machine!

**Speed Checker Design**: <br>
This project is partenered and sponsored by the Public Safety department here at the University of Hartford. More information will be provided soon on this platform. 

**Tennis Court Reservation & Management Website**: More information on this project will be provided soon

**Travel Itinerary WebApp**: Design of a web application that uses API calls to provide a personalized itinerary from chatGPT Model 3.5. More information will be uploaded soon.

**Vehicle Guidance System**: More information on this project will be provided soon
